            <p>Zara is one of the largest international fashion companies. It belongs to Inditex, one of the world's largest distribution groups. 
            The customer is at the heart of our unique business model, which includes design, production, distribution and sales through our extensive retail network.
            Zara tends to ride over the wave of trend. They bring in whatever is currently hot and trendy, often making affordable copycat versions of high end fashions. 
            The store prides itself on getting new designs in stores within 2 weeks.
